This is a simple example of urlrewrite using tuckey's urlrewrite filter.

##Installation
Due to the way git and eclipse structured as described here this project need some manual setup before it will work: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Eclipse_Workspace_and_Repository_working_directory.

Eclipse's git import feature will not work in this repository setup.

The way I preferred to do is as following:

1. In eclipse, create a new Dynamic Web Project same as this repository name.
2. Download zip or clone this repository to your computer.
3. Navigate to your eclipse workspace, copy & overwrite the empty web project with the repository content.
4. Now the demo should work properly.
